Expect Command

Expect is named after the specific command which waits for outþut from a program.

ABSTRACT Shells provide minimal control (starting, stopping, etc) over programs, leaving interaction up to users. This means that you cannot run some programs non-interactively, such as passwd. 

expect crosses this line, solving several long-standing problems in the UNIX environment.

Before we talk about expect command, let’s see some of the expect command which used for interaction:
  	spawn                  Starting a script or a program.
  	expect                 Waiting for program output.
  	send                   Sending a reply to your program.
  	interact               Allowing you in interact with your program.
  
•	The spawn command is used to start a script or a program like the shell, FTP, Telnet, SSH, SCP, and so on.
•	The send command is used to send a reply to a script or a program.
•	The Expect command waits for input.
•	The interact command allows you to define a predefined user interaction.

Expect language is ported to many languages like C#, Java, Perl, Python, Ruby and Shell with almost the same concepts and syntax due to its simplicity and importance.

Expect scripting language is used in quality assurance, network measurements such as echo response time, automate file transfers, updates, and many other uses.
